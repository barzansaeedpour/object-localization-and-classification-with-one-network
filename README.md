# Object Localization and Classification with One Network on MNIST Dataset

This repository contains code and resources for performing object localization and classification using a single network on the MNIST dataset. The project aims to demonstrate how a convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained to not only classify handwritten digits but also localize the bounding boxes around them.

## Introduction

Object localization refers to the process of identifying the location of objects within an image, often by drawing bounding boxes around them. Classification, on the other hand, involves assigning a label or class to an object. This project combines both tasks by training a CNN to recognize and locate handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is grayscale and has a resolution of 28x28 pixels. The dataset is widely used as a benchmark for image classification tasks.
